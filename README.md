**Everforest**

## Small Description

<ins>**Everforest**</ins> is a GTK theme based on the colour palette of the [Everforest for Neovim](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) by [@Sainnhe](https://github.com/sainnhe), the [Graphite GTK theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Graphite-gtk-theme) by [@VinceLiuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice) and the [Suru Plus](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus) icons by [@gusbemacbe.](https://github.com/gusbemacbe)

The idea was born from the need for **GTK** themes that match the most prominent colour palettes of **Neovim** code editor and **Tiling Window Manager**, such as **Xmonad**, **Awesome**, **DWM**, etc, which use these colour schemes to give a uniform and unique look to working environments. See on **Reddit:** [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

The colour palettes in this series of themes are the ones I have used the most in my setup for **Neovim**, **Xmonad** and **Gnome DE**, so creating themes started as something personal that I then decided to share thanks to several people asking me to share them because they seemed good, I hope you find them useful and make your desktops look good too.

## Installing Themes

Before applying the themes you need to check if the `Murrine Engine` package is already installed on your distro, as it is necessary for the correct rendering of the themes.
Depending on your Linux distro, the package may have a different name, here are the package names in some distro: On Fedora: `gtk-murrine-engine`, OpenSUSE: `gtk2-engine-murrine`, Arch: `gtk-engine-murrine`, Debian and derivatives: `gtk2-engines-murrine`

Themes work in <ins>**Gnome 40, 41 and 42 versions**,</ins> but since Gnome 42 introduced [<ins>**libadwaita**</ins>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwaita_(design_language)) the themes files for <ins>**GTK4**</ins> applications must be placed in a new directory in a new path: **`'~/.config/gtk-4.0'`** with the name **`'gtk.css'`**; this will apply the themes automatically without use **Gnome Tweaks** but, for **GTK3** applications, we must always use **Tweaks** as we have done so far.

To install the [themes](https://www.pling.com/u/fkorpsvart) you will need to download <ins>**two files**</ins>, themes for **GTK3** and **GTK4**.
The **GTK4** themes have the specification: <ins>**'Gnome42' or just 'G42'**</ins>, these themes go in the path: **`'~/.config/gtk-4.0/'`**, and **GTK3** themes go to the usual path, this is: **`'~/.themes/'`**.

As I mentioned before, the **GTK4** themes don't need to be applied with **Tweaks**, they are applied automatically but, if you have applications open you will have to close and open them for the theme to be applied, but for GTK3 applications you do need to apply them with **Tweaks**, as usual.

## Clarifying some doubts.

Some people have told me that they find the names a bit complicated and confusing because of the abbreviations I have put next to the name of each theme.
I have abbreviated the themes because I don't like to put such long names like: **`Material-Deep-Ocean-Borderless-Legacy-Buttons-Gnome-42`**, Admittedly, it is a very explicit name, but it is a ridiculously long name. so I decided to abbreviate the different versions for each theme, like **`Tokyonight-Dark-BL-LB-G42`**, so to clarify the abbreviations here is a small table.

| Abbreviation example | Explanation of abbreviations |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Theme-Name-B      |Theme with `Border` decoration                                 |
| Theme-Name-B-LB   |Theme with `Border` decoration and `Legacy Buttons` in Windows |
| Theme-Name-B-G42  |Theme with `Border` decoration for `Gnome 42` version          |
| Theme-Name-B-GS   |Theme with `Border` decoration for `Gnome Shell`               |
| Theme-Name-BL     |Theme `Borderless` decoration                                  |
| Theme-Name-BL-LB  |Theme `Borderless` decoration and `Legacy Buttons` in Windows  |
| Theme-Name-BL-G42 |Theme `Borderless` decoration for `Gnome 42` version           |
| Theme-Name-BL-GS  |Theme `Borderless` decoration for `Gnome Shell`                |
